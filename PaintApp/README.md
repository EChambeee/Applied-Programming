# Overview

I am trying to get familiar with android studios and how to create an app.

I created a paint app wher you can draw what you want with colors and button to erase or clear. You can also save what you draw.

I created this app because I thought it would be fun to create a drawing app on a phone. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
