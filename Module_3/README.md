# Overview

This project helped me to understand how beckend systems interact with databasses by buiding a database that you can add, view, search, and delete movies.

This software is a command-line interface where users can interact with the database. They can add a movie with title, view all the movies in the database, search for the specific movie by title, and delete a movie.

My purpose for writin gthis was to get familiar with CRUD operations in SQL and backend integration.
