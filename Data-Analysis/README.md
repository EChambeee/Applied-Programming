# Overview

I am trying to get familiar with all sorts of programs and code so this is away to do it.

I am analyzing a sports game with all the stats of the players. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ryangoodwin/madden-21-weekly-player-ratings-top-800-players?resource=download

To see the different stats of the players and who is the best.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}
